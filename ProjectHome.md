# Welcome! #
Welcome to **OpenSwif**, a project that aims at being _the_ freeware, open source flash alternative.

## Why bother? ##
Well, Photoshop has the freeware GIMP as a competitor. Microsoft Office's freeware rival is OpenOffice.Org. Windows and Mac have the freeware competitor Linux. All of these programs have a free, open source alternative to them. The only program left without a serious FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) rival is Adobe Flash. LiveSwif is the only big one out there, but it's old, made by a company that disappeared years ago, and its coding is lost.
Openswif is inspired by Liveswif, the big free flash maker. OpenSwif strives to be what Liveswif might have been had it been maintained by the now-disappeared company. This project was started by the want, nay, the need, for a more updated version, and this project will come out as its own item.

## Can I help? ##
Sure, just go to either http://liveswifers.muux.org or to http://www.liveswifers.org and sign up. These are the big places for OpenSwif and LiveSwif. Signing up at either is nice, but signing up at both helps you more!
There is also a Google Groups, but this is really just if someone is logged into Google and wants to quickly talk about something without having to sign in to something else.

## Um... There's not a lot here ##
Yeah, the project has literally just been started, so don't immediately attack us (If you look through the liveswifers.org posts made in the past, you'll see this was being planned for a long time, only now are we seriously taking action).
